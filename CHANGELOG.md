# Changelog

Versions are the `VERSION` constant in `fbtodo` and the git tag of the same name.
Entries start at the newest release; each one is a contract change, not a diff.

## 4.29.0

### Added
- `fbtodo doctor` (and `doctor --json`): answers "can this machine show a pane?"
  as a gate — python, tmux, colour depth, locale, `ps`, `lsof`, where `cwd` comes
  from, the scratch directory, the watcher, the notifier kit, and whether a live
  instance was found. Exits non-zero only on a `fail`.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: both suites on Ubuntu and macOS, Python 3.9 and
  latest, in a UTF-8 256-colour environment.
- `clean_text()` / `clean_observation()`: escape sequences, control characters
  and bidirectional overrides are removed from session text at ingestion (the CLI
  reader and all `read_nas` paths) and again in `render()`, so a journal line
  cannot move the cursor, set a title, or reach the clipboard.
- Theme values are validated (`THEME_VALUE_RE`); a value that is not a colour is
  refused and reported as `theme_problems` by `status` and `status --json`, and
  the role falls back to the next source down rather than to the built-in.
- A claim on `LOCK_PATH` is now held by `flock` on the record's own descriptor:
  `lock_holder` probes it instead of trusting a stale pid, `clear_lock` refuses
  to unlink a claim it does not hold, and `--force` takes over deliberately.
- Cwd discovery asks `/proc/<pid>/cwd` first and falls back to one batched
  `lsof` call; freebuff is recognised by argv shape and executable, not by an
  absolute path.
- The size rung has a floor (`SHAPE_MIN_BUCKET = 4`): fewer than four calls is
  reported as remembered sizes, not as a measured bucket, and `status` says so.

### Changed
- Pane rendering: four inks (accent, active, success, muted) plus warn and error
  for state; a finished step is a dim tick; the active row carries its estimate
  as a badge; `GOAL` reads spent · total; the `PROGRESS` label and the pace/model
  strip are gone; the notes block is budgeted so a frame never exceeds `height`.
- Pane bell/notification text is metadata only by default (list summary, state,
  counts). The agent's own words are sent only with `FREEBUFF_PHONE_TEXT=agent`.
- `phone.sh --init` mints a 128-bit topic, and the macOS notification target is
  passed to osascript as argv rather than interpolated into a script.

### Fixed
- Two latent notify-suite defects: a commented-out line that still ran, and a
  race that counted a detached push.
- `#fff` is no longer accepted as a theme value (three-digit hex was never one).

<!-- Earlier releases: 4.29.0 is the first tagged release. Versions 4.19.0 through
     4.27.0 were bumped in-tree without a tag, so their changes are their commit
     subjects — `git log --oneline`. This file starts here rather than invent a
     history it cannot date. -->
